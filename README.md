## Overview

In this demo, we are using the [Unicorn HAT](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-unicorn-phat) with the [Pimoroni Mood Light Kit](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mood-light-pi-zero-w-project-kit?variant=38477389450) which is powered by a [Raspbery Pi Zero WH](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w?variant=39458414264403).

There are two companion apps - one for iOS and Android - which offer the ability to control the mood light via Ditto's P2P data sync. The mood light itself is powered by a Rust application which listens for data change events from the companion apps and then changes the light color. The Rust app uses pyo3 to call the python libraries from Pimoroni to control the Unicorn HAT.

## Requirements

* [Pimoroni Mood Light Kit](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mood-light-pi-zero-w-project-kit?variant=38477389450)
* iOS app requires iOS 16 as it is using a new SwiftUI Color Wheel component

## Setup

1. Request an offline license token through the [Portal](https://portal.ditto.live) and replace "YOUR_OFFLINE_TOKEN" with that value in all apps (iOS, Android, and moodlight-rs).

2. Copy `moodlight-rs` to the Raspberry Pi.

```
scp -r moodlight-rs pi@raspberrypi.local:~/
```


3. Install Raspbery Pi OS and follow the [getting started guide](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-unicorn-phat) for the Unicorn HAT to install the required firmware for the light:

4. Install rust on the Raspberry Pi

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

5. [Configure the Raspberry Pi to support Bluetooth Low Energy with Ditto](https://docs.ditto.live/raspberrypi/installation)

6. Compile `moodlight-rs` manually on the Raspberry Pi:

```
cd moodlight-rs
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib DITTOFFI_SEARCH_PATH=./ LIBDITTO_STATIC=0 cargo build --target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

7. Run it on Rpi

//TODO

8. Run iOS or Android apps on a companion device to control the light!


## Troubleshooting

* Ensure you're using a high-quality SD card.
* If Rust installation fails, you may need to increase the [swap size](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-swap-file/) on your Raspberry Pi. (see [this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/2717))
